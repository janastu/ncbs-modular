		<h1 class="text-left">13 WAYS</h1> 
		<h2>Concept note</h2> 

		<p>On Oct 22, 1991, the Department of Atomic Energy sent a letter to the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research, conveying the President's sanction for a new biology research centre in Bangalore. Only upon looking back, however, does the letter appear as a bookend of sorts to what really was a decade-plus process in realizing a National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), which completed 25 years in 2016.</p>

		<blockquote><p>“When you are in the middle of a story, it isn't a story at all, but only a confusion, a dark roaring, a blindness. It is only afterwards that it becomes anything like a story when you're telling it to yourself or someone else.”</p>
		<span class="text"> -- Stories We Tell. Sarah Polley. 2012</span>
		</blockquote>
		 
		<p>As mentioned in the opening curatorial note, stories sometimes surface by bestowing significance on available material. 13 Ways is a pilot exhibit from the NCBS Archives (paying homage to Wallace Stevens' poem, Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird). Built around multiple ways to reflect upon and assemble the history of the institution, the exhibit brings to light a tangled history and unlikely journey, weaved by over 70 story tellers, over 600 photographs, official records, letters, and the occasional lab note. Where does meaning reside in an archival document? And how can we better engage with archival repositories to form stories?</p>
		 
		<p>The exhibit is an attempt to answer these questions through the history of an institution. It is the first phase of a digital experiment in archiving, journalism and storytelling. In the next phase, we hope to release a standard open source template for anyone to build similar exhibits. The template would allow the public to pull material from a variety of primary and secondary sources into coherent stories, and connect personal stories to established records of a scientific process. Following that, in a third phase, we hope to start forming networks of stories based on material from a repository of interconnected archives.</p>
